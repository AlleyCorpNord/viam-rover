## Cartography

The majority of making the SLAM stuff work is done by configuring the LIDAR
component on the VIAM web interface.

In this module we demonstrate grabbing the realtime output of the LIDAR and
printing the closest detected point.

There is also a POC ``.pbstream`` reader but it is unused.
